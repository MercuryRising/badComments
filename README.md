# Just what you need to add terrible comments to your source code.
Who added these comments? How did this get here... is this really the secret key to the database!?!?

# Usage
Grab badComments.py, run it with 

> python badComments.py SOURCE_FILE

Make sure to push the changes into your master branch. 
Bonus points if you can attribute the changes to someone else.

## Coming soon
Foreign language support to add a bit of paranoia to future maintainers
