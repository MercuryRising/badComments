# Just what you need to add bad comments to your source code.
Who added these comments? How did this get here... is this really the secret key to the database!?!?

You'll never go back to your current commenting style.

# Usage
Grab badComments.py, run it with 

> python badComments.py SOURCE_FILE

Make sure to push the changes into your master branch. 
Bonus points if you can attribute the changes to someone else.

It currently works with C, C++, Haskell, Perl, Ruby, Python, Javascript, and HTML. It's only been tested with Python. 

## Coming soon
* Foreign language support to add a bit of paranoia to future maintainers.
* Random functions that are unrelated to anything you're working on.
* Random function calls that add significant overhead, making you seem like a hero when you make the program run 10x faster
